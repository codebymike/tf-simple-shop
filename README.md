# TF / Simple Shop

## Instructions

A fruit shop is having a new EPOS developed, and you are tasked with building the checkout system.

The system needs to be supported with sensible level of unit test coverage, the first few have been written for you.

### Part I

```
The shop only sells 3 types of fruit: apples for 60p, oranges for 25p, and bananas for 55p

Build a checkout system which takes an array of items scanned at the till and outputs the total cost.

Example: [ "Apple", "Apple", "Orange", "Apple", "Banana" ] => Â£2.60
```

### Part II

```
Update the existing checkout code to support a "buy one get one free" offer on apples.
```

### Part III

```
Update the existing checkout code to support a "3 for the price of 2" offer on oranges.
```
